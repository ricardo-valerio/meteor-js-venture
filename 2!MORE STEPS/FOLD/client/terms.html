            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>Thanks for using FOLD! Before you start using the service, we want to make you aware of your rights as a user and some of our policies. These policies will likely evolve and change as FOLD grows. We welcome any feedback you may have, and the team can be reached at <a class="green" href="mailto:fold@media.mit.edu">fold@media.mit.edu.</a> These terms are effective April 13th, 2014.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Some key words:</h2>
            <p><b>“Narrative cards”</b>: Narrative cards form the backbone of a FOLD story. A row of context cards is associated with individual narrative cards.</p>
            <p><b>“Context Cards”</b>: Context cards surround narrative cards. They can be explored with the left and right arrows, or linked directly to words and phrases in a narrative card. Context cards bring in multimedia elements, including videos, maps, photos, gifs, tweets, interactive data visualizations, text, and more.</p>
            <p><b>“Stories”</b>: A story is your collection of narrative and context cards.</p>
            <p><b>“Remixing”</b>: Any context card can be remixed by another author. If it is remixed, the new card will link back to the original story and provide attribution to the author who first created it.</p>
