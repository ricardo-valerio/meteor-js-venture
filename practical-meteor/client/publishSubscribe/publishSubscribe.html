  <h2>Publish & Subscribe</h2>
  <p>
    In Meteor you need to subscribe data you want to show on the client and publish them on the server.
    As I mentioned in <a href="{{pathFor 'autopublishAndInsecure'}}">previous chapter</a>
    meteor app includes autopublish package by default which causes all your data in MongoDB are
    published/downloaded to the client (MiniMongo). When we remove autopublish package
    (<i>$ meteor remove autopublish</i>) there are no data on the client.
    Wee need to publish data on the server and subscribe to them on the client.
  </p>

  <h3>Publish on the server</h3>

<pre>
Meteor.publish('books', function() {
  return Books.find();
});
</pre>

  <p>We created a publish function called 'books' so we can subscribe for the books on the client.</p>

  <h3>Subscribe on the client</h3>

  <p>I removed autopublish package from this app so we need to subscribe for data. Try it in your console:</p>

<pre>var booksSub = Meteor.subscribe('books');</pre>

  <p>Now you should see books:</p>

  {{> books}}

  <p>If text 'No books' is shown, there are probably no data for books. Add one:</p>

<pre>
Books.insert({ title: 'Discover Meteor', author: 'Tom Coleman & Sacha Greif'});
</pre>
