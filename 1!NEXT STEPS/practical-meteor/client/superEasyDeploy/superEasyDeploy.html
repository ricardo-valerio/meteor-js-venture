  <h2>Super easy deploy</h2>

  <p>
    I bet you learned some framework and then wondered how to deploy your app. And I bet it was not
    easy. And I bet you will be surprised how super easy it is with Meteor.
  </p>

  <p>To deploy meteor app, just type in your bash (you must be in the root of your meteor project):</p>
<pre>
$ meteor deploy sitename
</pre>

  <p>Where sitename is the name of your app. The app will be deployed on Meteor's server. You can see
    the app on http://sitename.meteor.com.
  </p>

  <p>If you have your own server you can use <a href="https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up">Meteor up</a>
    package.
