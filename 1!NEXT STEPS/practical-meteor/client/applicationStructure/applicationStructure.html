    With great power, comes great responsibility. You can structure your app as you want
    but you need to understand some basic principles for

  <p>
    I recommend not to have more than 500 lines of code in 1 file.
    You should have <i>client</i> and <i>server</i> folders in your project to determine
    which code is used on the client and which is used on the server. Also you can name <i>common</i>
    folder for code which is used on both - server and client side, for example
    some functions and collections.
