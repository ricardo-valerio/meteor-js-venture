  <h2>Packages</h2>
  <p>You can easily add <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#packages">packages</a>
    with "<i>$ meteor add packagename</i>" command.
    For example "<i>$ meteor add less</i>" will add less package and you can immediately
    create *.less files and start writing less code. Really that simple.
  </p>

  <h3>Third party packages</h3>
  <p>
    There are plenty of packages on <a href="http://atmospherejs.com/">Atmosphere</a> created by
    Meteor's community. Probably anything you find on Bower or NPM you will find on Atmosphere. If not,
    just <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/docs/publishing">create Meteor package</a>. It's easy.
  </p>
  <p>Reasons why Meteor has it's own packages is

      more
    </a>.
    The main reason is that packages can contain server and client code (even templates).
